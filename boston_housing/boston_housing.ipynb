In this notebook, some template code has already been provided for you, and you will need to implement additional functionality to successfully complete this project. You will not need to modify the included code beyond what is requested. Sections that begin with **'Implementation'** in the header indicate that the following block of code will require additional functionality which you must provide. Instructions will be provided for each section and the specifics of the implementation are marked in the code block with a 'TODO' statement. Please be sure to read the instructions carefully!\n",

Each section where you will answer a question is preceded by a **'Question X'** header.

    "## Getting Started\n",
    "In this project, you will evaluate the performance and predictive power of a model that has been trained and tested on data collected from homes in suburbs of Boston, Massachusetts. A model trained on this data that is seen as a *good fit* could then be used to make certain predictions about a home — in particular, its monetary value. This model would prove to be invaluable for someone like a real estate agent who could make use of such information on a daily basis.\n",

    "The dataset for this project originates from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Housing). The Boston housing data was collected in 1978 and each of the 506 entries represent aggregated data about 14 features for homes from various suburbs in Boston, Massachusetts. For the purposes of this project, the following preprocessing steps have been made to the dataset:\n",
    "- 16 data points have an `'MEDV'` value of 50.0. These data points likely contain **missing or censored values** and have been removed.\n",
    "- 1 data point has an `'RM'` value of 8.78. This data point can be considered an **outlier** and has been removed.\n",
    "- The features `'RM'`, `'LSTAT'`, `'PTRATIO'`, and `'MEDV'` are essential. The remaining **non-relevant features** have been excluded.\n",
    "- The feature `'MEDV'` has been **multiplicatively scaled** to account for 35 years of market inflation.\n",

    "**Answer:** The four panels in the figure actually shows the performance transition from a high biased model to an overfitted model:\n",
    "* max_depth = 1: this is a decision tree with very low complexity. The testing score quickly satuates at 50 samples, with a score below 0.5. Additional training samples do not improve the performance any more. And the training score also drops below 0.5 and meets the testing score eventually. This indicates that the model is not complex enough to capture all the underlying structures in the dataset. In this case, adding training points would have no impact on the model. \n",
    "* max_depth = 3: the model fits the data points well. Both curves meet around 0.75-0.8 which is a decent to good accuracy. Satuation occurs around 300 samples. After that, adding more training samples would not better or worsen the performance.  \n",
    "* max_depth = 6 and 10: The gap between the testing and training scores suggest that these two models both overfit the datasets. The wider gap in max_depth = 10 case indicates higher variance in the model. Eventually the model seems to reach a performance in a range of 0.6-0.65. Curves in the figures also suggest that adding samples would not significantly higher the scores. "

Grid search is advantageous when the model is highly nonlinear, contains noncontinuity or stochasticity, or there is no closed form derivation (or very hard to perform mathematical analysis). But grid search also suffers problems like heavier computational burden, unknown hyperparameter testing range (how do we ensure the testing range indeed supersets the optimal), unknown hyperparameter testing stepsize for continuous hyperparameters (what stepsize to choose: 1? 0.1? 0.0001?), etc. \n",

But the model does not under-estimate this place at all. First, this house may be located in impoverished areas in Boston, reflected by the poverty level. The poverty level is high as 1/3, meaning the neighborhood is fulled with the poor, the homeless, which also strongly suggests high potential crime rate and possible drug activities. Such region, not surprisingly, also faces the situation of deteriorated social amenities or resources. The 22-to-1 student-teacher ratio is clearly a reflection of incomplete educational infrastructures. Last the house has only 4 rooms, which is usually a small and possibly decrepit housing unit in Boston. \n",
    "* Second, the most expensive house:  Client 3's home. The price is high as 921900.00 which is close to the maximum (1024800.00), making it one of the most expensive properties in Boston. And there are reasons to it, if we look at the features. First, this should be a house in those luxury neighborhoods of Boston. The poverty level is 3% very close to 0%, meaning the neighborhood is an affluent region populated with expensive homes. Such neighborhood is usually supported by superior law enforcement and luxury amenities or services, such as the good education resources (12-to-1 student-teacher ratio). Residents will not have to worry about safety issues either. The house itself is also very large, containing 8 rooms. This also adds values to the house price.\n",
    "* Client 1's house is somewhere in the middle. The estimate price is about the average and the conditions also average. This is reasonable because it is better than Client 2's house in every aspect but also looks pretty poor if compared to Client 3's home. One plus about this house is the decent access to education resources, shown by the 15-1 student-teacher ratio. The problem about this place is probably the room number. This house seems very small, having only 5 rooms (if we assume each room is normal-sized, rather than stadium like rooms). Neighborhood with poverty level higher than 15% usually means lack of reliable social services or law enforcement. Here the 17% poverty level may also be a reason that lowers the estimate. "
